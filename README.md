# Crypto
A simple implementation of the shamir secret sharing scheme
The python 3+ program asks for the inputs n,t and the secret and computes the shares and displays them. It can then also be recovered and shown. The only package used is the inbuilt package,random. Note that this package is not cryptographically secure and should not be assumed to be so.
